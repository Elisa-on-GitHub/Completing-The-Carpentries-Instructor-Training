# Completing-The-Carpentries-Instructor-Training

## About this repository
I created this repository to keep track of my progress towards completing The Carpentries Instructor Training. Most of this will be done on the project board connected to this repository.
I will mostly use issues as cards on the project board.

## The Carpentries and Instructor Training
The Carpentries is an organisation that has as its goal to teach ['foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide'](https://carpentries.org/). Learners can take [workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) in the curricula of Data, Software and Library Carpentries.
As part of the [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/), I will have to:
1. Contribute to a lesson or glossary of The Carpentries
2. Attend and contribute to a community discussion (12 July)
3. Teach a demo lesson (20 July).

## How to contribute to this repository
